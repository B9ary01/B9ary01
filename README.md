I'm Bishal, currently living in London. I'm a graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Goldsmiths, University of London. I am currently working as a tech trainee at futureproof in London.

I am enthusiastic and driven when it comes to coding and technology in general. My interest in learning and problem solving led me to develop a passion for technology. I am passionate about continuous learning, collaboration and providing solutions to problems. I love building projects using new tools and technologies. During my spare time, I like to go out,
listen to music and play online chess.
